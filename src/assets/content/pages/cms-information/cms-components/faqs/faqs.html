<h2>FaqComponent Instructions</h2>

<p>
  The FaqComponent is designed to display a list of frequently asked questions along with their answers. It renders the questions in a clickable list and, when a question is selected, smoothly scrolls to the corresponding answer. Each answer section also includes a "Back to Top" link for easy navigation.
