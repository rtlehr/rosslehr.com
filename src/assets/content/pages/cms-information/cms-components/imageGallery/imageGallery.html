<h2>ImageGalleryComponent Instructions</h2>

<p>
  The ImageGalleryComponent displays a gallery of images in a responsive, card-based layout using Bootstrap classes. Each image card contains an image, title, short description, and a "Learn More" button linking to an external resource.
</p>

<h3>Component Inputs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Input Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>fileToLoad</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        The path to the JSON file containing image data (e.g., 'image-data.json'). The file is loaded from the assets folder.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>divId</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        An identifier assigned to the main container of the gallery, useful for styling or DOM targeting.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>JSON Data Structure</h3>
<p>
  The component expects the JSON file to be an array of image objects with the following structure:
</p>
<pre><code class="json">
[
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/motorcycle.png",
      "title": "Image 1",
      "description": "This is a short description for Image 1.",
      "href": "https://example.com/image1"
    },
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/snowtruck.jpg",
      "title": "Image 1",
      "description": "This is a short description for Image 1.",
      "href": "https://example.com/image1"
    },
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/flag.jpeg",
      "title": "Image 1",
      "description": "This is a short description for Image 1.",
      "href": "https://example.com/image1"
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>
  In this structure, the <code>src</code> property specifies the path of the image file, <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> provide the textual content for the card, and <code>href</code> defines the URL for the "Learn More" link.
</p>
