<h2>NewsComponent Instructions</h2>

<p>
  The NewsComponent is designed to fetch and display a list of news articles using Angular's HttpClient. It loads the news data from a JSON file specified by the <code>fileToLoad</code> input and renders each news item with a thumbnail image, title, publication date, an excerpt of the content, and a "Read More" button.
</p>

<h3>JSON Data Structure</h3>
