    <p>With over <strong>27 years of experience</strong> in web, graphic, and multimedia development, I've built a career blending creativity with technical precision. I've spent more than a decade supporting the <strong>Intelligence Community, Department of Justice and commercial clients</strong>, creating mission-critical web applications, online training, and digital interfaces that are both visually engaging and highly functional.</p>

    <p>I currently serve as a <strong>Senior Web and Multimedia Developer</strong>, leading projects in <strong>HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Joomla, and ServiceNow</strong>. My work ranges from crafting <strong>Web-Based Training (WBT)</strong> environments and building custom CMS platforms to designing UI/UX standards and full branding suites. I take pride in transforming complex ideas into user-friendly solutions that make a real impact.</p>

    <p>Along the way, I've stayed passionate about continuous learning, earning certifications in <strong>ServiceNow Front-End Development, AngularJS, Accessibility, and AWS Essentials</strong>. Whether developing new interfaces or refining visual communication, I'm driven by a commitment to quality, innovation, and design that connects people with information.</p>
