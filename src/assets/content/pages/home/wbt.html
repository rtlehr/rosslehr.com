Build courses fast with our modular WBT framework: a jQuery + Bootstrap starter powered by SASS, responsive media mixins, and reusable UI patterns for quick development. It’s accessible by design—skip links, keyboard focus management, reduced-motion support, and ARIA helpers are baked in—so you meet SOP/a11y standards without extra work. Plug in LMS hooks (SCORM/xAPI-ready stubs) for tracking, gating, and completions, and use the JSON-driven content loader, page router, and transform-based animation engine to assemble polished lessons in minutes. Developer niceties like a dev tools panel, grid overlay, hot-reload friendliness, and a consistent component library make iteration effortless—on desktop, tablet, and phone.  </div>
