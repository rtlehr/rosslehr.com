<h2>ImageDisplayComponent Instructions</h2>

<p>
  The ImageDisplayComponent is designed to display a gallery of images loaded from a JSON data file. It renders clickable thumbnails for public images and a placeholder for private images. When a public image is clicked, the component opens a modal window displaying a larger version of the image along with its title and description.

<h3>Component Inputs</h3>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Input Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>fileToLoad</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        The path to the JSON file containing image data (e.g., 'images-data.json'). The file is loaded from the assets folder.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>divId</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        An identifier assigned to the main gallery container for targeting or styling purposes.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>JSON Data Structure</h3>
<p>
  The component expects the JSON file to be an array of image objects with the following structure:
</p>
<pre><code class="json">
[
    {
        "id": "1",
        "src": "./assets/images/flag.jpeg",
        "largeSrc": "./assets/images/flag.jpeg",
        "title": "Image 1",
        "description": "This is the description for Image 1.",
        "private": "false" 
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "src": "./assets/images/airplane.jpeg",
        "largeSrc": "./assets/images/airplane.jpeg",
        "title": "Image 1",
        "description": "This is the description for Image 1.",
        "private": "true"
    },
    {
        "id": "3",
        "src": "./assets/images/motorcycle.png",
        "largeSrc": "./assets/images/motorcycle.png",
        "title": "Image 1",
        "description": "This is the description for Image 1.",
        "private": "false"
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>
  In this structure, the <code>src</code> property holds the path for the thumbnail image, while the <code>largeSrc</code> is used in the modal view. The <code>private</code> property determines whether the actual image or a placeholder image should be displayed.
</p>
